# C# Lessons

## Introduction

This is my repository for learning the basics of C#. My goal is to relearn the basic foundations of programming, and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
If you are a beginner like me in C#, you can clone this repository to learn and understand the syntax of C# as well as to learn the language itself.
Happy coding everyone!
